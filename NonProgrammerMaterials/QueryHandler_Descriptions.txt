Behaviours
________________________________________


bytes Before
    Finds the bytes before a given character in the response content.


handle Generic Query Response
        Base method to handle the response for the generic query request. It waits for the first few bytes on the actual response to determine if an error is raised or if a successful response can be expected. The actual error and/or chunk parsing is deferred to other parts of this handler.


parse Query Response
    Generic dispatch method to parse the query response chunks. Depending on the state the parser is currently in, several different sub-methods are called which do the actual handling. 


transition To Next Token
    Peek the next token, returning the QUERY_STATE corresponding to it and placing the readerIndex just after the token's ':'. Must be at the end of the previous token.



find End
    Finds the end of a token.


parse Query Signature
    Parses the query signature.

parse Query Rows
    Parses the query rows from the content stream as long as there is data to be found.
